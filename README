This Xdialog written by Cyberone Internet.

Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the cdialog program.
It converts any terminal based program into a program with an X-windows
interface. The dialogs are easier to see and use and the treeview adds an
extra dimension to the way menus can be displayed.

If you have any problems/bugs contact alfred@cyberone.com.au and I will
try to help.

Please read the INSTALL file for installation instructions. 


Commands - 
Xdialog functions exactly as cdialog does, and it accepts the same command
line parameters. It also has an added treeview mode which can be very
handy.

Here is the command line arguments it accepts:

Usage: Xdialog <Common options> <Box options>

Common options:
       [--backtitle <backtitle>]    - the menubar title
       [--title <title>]            - Another part of the title 
       [--password ]                - make input to the screen '*' (ala
password entry screens)

Box options:
  --yesno     <text> <height> <width>
  --msgbox    <text> <height> <width>
  --infobox   <text> <height> <width>
  --inputbox  <text> <height> <width> [<init>]
  --textbox   <file> <height> <width>
  --menu      <text> <height> <width> <menu height> <tag1> <item1>...
  --checklist <text> <height> <width> <list height> <tag1> <item1> <status1>...
  --radiolist <text> <height> <width> <list height> <tag1> <item1> <status1>...
  --treeview  <text> <height> <width> <list height> <tag1> <item1> <status1> <item_depth1>...
  --guage     <text> <height> <width> <percent>
  --tailbox   <file> <height> <width>
  --tailboxbg <file> <height> <width>       
 

The only thing of note here is the treeview depth. This is the number of
levels in the tree entry should be, and it should *never* increase by more
than 1 at a time (decreasing by more than 1 is fine).

Xdialog v1.4.6, 15/12/00: Bug fixes and further development by Thierry Godefroy
<xdialog@free.fr> (web site: http://xdialog.free.fr):

1.- Bug fixes:
    ~~~~~~~~~
- The <height> and <width> parameters are now actually taken into account. They
  must be specified in "lines" (12 pixels high each) and "characters" (8 pixels
  wide each). The 8x12 character size may be changed at compile time only by
  defining XSIZE_MULT and/or YSIZE_MULT in the CPPFLAGS line of the
  src/Makefile (e.g. CPPFLAGS = -DXSIZE_MULT=10 -DYSIZE_MULT=18).
  These two parameters may also be replaced by a single <XSIZExYSIZE> parameter
  that will specify the size in pixels (this size will be rounded to the next
  "character" boundary). Passing 0 0 (or 0x0) to Xdialog for its window size
  will make it to auto-size.

- The <text> is now actually displayed by checklist, radiolist, menu, etc...

- The treeview options is debugged and now takes parameters in the order in
  which they are documented (it used to mess up the tags, the status and the
  item names). Note that the "<status>" ("on" or "off") although taken into
  account for the item tag returned as default, does not hilight the "on"
  item (because of what looks like a GTK+ bug...).

- The <tag>s are now displayed before the <item>s in checklist and radiolist
  (same behaviour as with "(c)dialog"). But as hidding them may be useful too,
  I added the transient "--no-tags" option, which may also be used with the
  "menubox" widget.

2.- Changes and improvements:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- It is now possible to chain dialogs in a single Xdialog command line. The
  chain is broken as soon as a "cancel" button is pressed or the box is closed
  (see the "chain" example script in the "samples" directory).
  Note though that in this case no parameter can be defaulted in the
  <Box options>.

- Distinction has been made between "common options" (that will affect all the
  following "box options" until the same or opposite "common options" are
  encountered in the command line) and "transient options" that only apply to
  the next "box option" in the command line. The "--passwd" option has been
  made a "transient option".

- The <file> parameter of "--textbox", "--editbox" and "--tailbox(bg)" may be
  replaced by a minus sign ("-"). In this case stdin is used as the input file,
  which allow to pipe data to Xdialog.

- The infobox now accepts an optional <timeout> parameter (the default is 1000
  and will make the infobox to vanish after one second) and no more waits
  forever for the "OK" button to be pressed (this makes infobox behave much
  more closer to the "(c)dialog" infobox).
  When timeout is set to 0, then infobox behaves differently:
   - The "OK" button is replaced by a "Cancel" button (unless the --no-button
     option is given, in which case no button will be set up).
   - It accepts messages from stdin (much in the same way as the gauge widget).
     These messages may be "XXXX" (in which case the infobox is closed) or new
     <text> enclosed by "XXX" markers; as for the gauge widget, newlines can be
     inserted into the <text> (see below).
   - It waits until the "Cancel" button is pressed, or the "XXXX" message is
     received, or the stdin put at EOF.

- The "guage" widget has been properly renamed into "gauge" (but "guage" is
  still recognized for compatibility reasons).
  It does now behave much like the dialog gauge (it accepts percentage values
  on stdin as well as new <text> enclosed by two "XXX" markers; a newline can
  be inserted into the new <text> by isuing echo "\\n" between each line).
  Note that the <percent> parameter (which represents the initial gauge
  position) is now optional and defaults to 0.

- "--menu" has been renamed as "--menubox" but you still may use "--menu"
  because abreviated options are allowed.

- The tailbox  widget is displayed as soon as Xdialog is invoked (it used to
  appear only once 1024 characters were read from the input file).

- A new "--fselect" box option is implemented (GTK file selector). Using the
  "--no-button" transient option with "--fselect" prevents the "New directory",
  "Delete file" and "Rename file" buttons to be displayed in the file selector.
  The "--help" option is allowed and makes a help button to appear even if the
  "--no-buttons" option was specified. Note that the --backtitle option is
  ignored by fselect.

- A new "--dselect" box option is implemented (GTK directory selector). This
  box has the same behaviour as the file selector (see above).

- A new "--editbox" option is implemented. It takes the same parameters as the
  textbox but allows to edit the text and returns the edited text (after "OK"
  is pressed) on Xdialog output stream (i.e. stderr unless "--stdout" is in
  force).

- A new "--rangebox" option is implemented. It takes a <text> parameter
  together with a <min value>, a <max value> and an optional <default value>
  and displays the text together with a horizontal slider allowing to set a
  value that will be returned (printed to Xdialog output stream) by Xdialog.
  When the <default value> parameter is omitted, the default value is set to
  the <min value>.

- A new "--calendar" option is implemented. It takes a <text> parameter
  together with <day> (1 to 31) <month>, (1 to 12) and <year> (1970 and
  more) parameters and returns the user-selected date (in the form DD/MM/YYYY).
  any of <day>, <month> or <year> parameter may be given a value of 0 so that
  the current day, month or year is used as default.

- A new "--timebox" option is implemented. It takes a <text> parameter and
  returns the user-set time (in the form HH:MM:SS).

- "--left", "--right", "--center", "--wrap" and "--no-wrap" common options have
  been added so to instruct Xdialog to justify the text left, right or centered
  and/or to wrap (or not) long lines (line wrapping also apply to the
  "back-title" line). Default is --center --no-wrap.

- "--fixed-font" transient option added. This allows to use a monospacing font
  in the text area of tailbox, textbox and editbox widgets.

- "--screen-center" (default), "--under-mouse" and "--auto-placement" common
  options added so to control the Xdialog widgets placement.

- If the back-title line is empty (no --backtitle option in the command line),
  then it will not be displayed (Xdialog v1.0 used to display a "Cyberone -"
  line in this case).

- "--no-cancel" and "--no-buttons" options added.
  The "--no-cancel" option allows to suppress the "Cancel" button from all but
  the infobox, gauge and fselect widgets.
  The "--no-buttons" option allows to suppress all the "OK", the "Cancel",
  the "Help" and the "Print" buttons from the tailbox(bg), textbox and infobox
  widgets, as well as the "New directory", "Delete file" and "Rename file"
  buttons from the fselect widget.
  Note that these options are transient ones and only apply to the next <Box
  option> listed in the command line.

- A new "--help" transient option has been added. This option is to be followed
  by the help text that will be displayed (in a msgbox) when the "Help" button
  is chosen. All widgets but the "gauge" and "fselect" ones got the help
  feature implemented. The <help> text following "--help" may hold "\n" (as for
  the <text> parameter) so to force help text line splitting.

- A new "--print" transient option has been added. It makes a "Print" button to
  appear in textbox, editbox and tailbox widgets (provided that the --no-button
  option was not specified). Hitting the button will make Xdialog to issue a
  printing command defined at compile time, defaulting to "lpr -P <printer>
  /tmp/Xdialog.tmp". The <printer> parameter (that must follow the "--print"
  option) gives the name of the printer to use. The "/tmp/Xdialog.tmp" file is
  a temporary file used by Xdialog and is deleted when Xdialog terminates. To
  see what printing command is used by your version of Xdialog, just invoke
  "Xdialog" (without parameter) and look at the last lines in the displayed
  usage.

- A new "--buttons-style" common option has been added. It must be followed by
  a parameter (the style name, case sensitive !) which must be either "default"
  (both icon and text in each button), "icon" (icon only in each button) or
  "text" (text only in each button).

- New "--stderr" and "--stdout" options added. The default behaviour of Xdialog
  is to mimic (c)dialog and send all its results to stderr. This may sometimes
  be inapropriate and you may want to get separate output (one for the true
  errors/warnings and one for the result). This is why the "--stdout" common
  option was implemented: it makes Xdialog to output all the widgets results
  to stdout instead of stderr. The "--stderr" common option is there so that you
  can revert to the default stderr output in a chained dialogs command line.

- New "--wmclass" common option added. This option allows to set the window
  manager class name for Xdialog so that its window may be differenciated and
  decorated differently from other applications windows. This, of course, will
  depend on your window manager features... This also allows to use different
  decorations for different scripts using Xdialog. The --wmclass option must be
  followed by a <name> (the wmclass name of Xdialog then becomes
  <name>/<name>).

- New "--rc-file" common option added. This allows to change the GTK+ theme
  for the following box options into the Xdialog command line. This option must
  be followed by the name of a file in the gtkrc format.

- New "--icon" transient option added. This option must be followed by the
  filename of an icon (in XPM format only). This icon will be displayed on
  the left of the <text> (provided the following box option accepts such a
  <text> parameter). If the filename does not corresponds to a XPM image, the
  option will be ignored.

- New "--version" special option added. This option makes Xdialog to prints its
  version number to stderr and to exit. This is useful to check from a script
  if the installed version of Xdialog is able to use some of the latest widgets
  that have been implemented since Xdialog exists...

- When the Xdialog window is closed via the window manager, an exit code of 255
  is now returned (same exit code as for the (c)dialog ESC event). 255 is also
  returned when an error occured (bad options or parameters, GUI initialisation
  failure) in Xdialog.
  Two new common options have been implemented: "--no-close" that prevents the
  dialogs to be closed with the window manager close button and "--allow-close"
  allowing to revert to default behaviour of allowing the window manager to
  close the dialogs.

- The Xdialog usage while still printed to stderr is now also displayed into a
  textbox.

- Xdialog may be compiled so to use french buttons labels (by passing the
  --with-french-labels options to the "configure" script).

3.- Distribution changes:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Examples of how to use Xdialog are given into the "samples" directory (many
  of these examples are adapted from the "cdialog" ones).
- Xdialog.spec added into the tarball.
- Added a FAQ.


The new usage for Xdialog v1.4.6 is therefore:
