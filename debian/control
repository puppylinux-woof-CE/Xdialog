Description: X11 replacement for the text util dialog
 Xdialog is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the dialog and
 cdialog programs. It converts any terminal-based program into a program
 with an X interface. The dialogs are easier to see and use, and Xdialog
 adds more functionality such as a help button and box, a treeview, an
 editbox, file and directory selectors, a range box, and a calendar. It
 uses GTK+, and will match your desktop theme.
